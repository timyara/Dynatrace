This one leverages the BizEvent Ingest API to send an event about a deployment.\n\n```\n// default function that will be run for the task\nexport default async function () {\n  // derive vesion from date\n  const now = new Date();\n  let hour = now.getHours();\n  var start = new Date(now.getFullYear(), 0, 0);\n  var diff = now - start;\n  var oneDay = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;\n  var day = Math.floor(diff / oneDay);\n  var buildId = 4711 + day + hour;\n\n  \n  // event that triggers validation\n  const event = { \n    \"timeframe.from\": \"now-32m\",\n    \"timeframe.to\": \"now-2m\",   \n    execution_context: {\n        buildId: \"\"+ buildId,\n        version: \"0.\" + day + \".\" + hour,\n        id: crypto.randomUUID().toString()\n    }, \n    \"tag.service\": \"carts\",\n\t\"tag.application\": \"sockshop\",\n\t\"tag.stage\": \"production\",\n    \"event.id\": crypto.randomUUID().toString(),\n    \"event.provider\": \"Jenkins\",\n    \"event.type\": \"DEPLOYMENT\"    \n  };\n\n  console.log(\"Ingesting event: \", event);\n\n  const ingestResponse = await fetch('/platform/classic/environment-api/v2/bizevents/ingest', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify(event),\n  }); \n\n  console.log(\"Event ingested\", ingestResponse.status, await ingestResponse.text());\n\n  return event[\"execution_context\"]\n}\n```"},{"id":"0a786b4f-1839-434b-989d-53e234e490b9","type":"markdown","markdown":"---"},{"id":"c0f65a02-1004-46cb-9197-b43af7111185","type":"markdown","markdown":"# Step 2: Analyze Events to measure Deployment Frequency\nThe following tiles use DQL to query the number of deployment events sent to Dynatrace.
