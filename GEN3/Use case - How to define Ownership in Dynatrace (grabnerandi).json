This feature allows you to not only see who owns a component but also allows targeted notifications as part of Workflows, e.g: send the right team a message in their slack channel when a problem comes up\n\n**Got questions or feedback?**: [devrel@dynatrace.com](mailto:devrel@dynatrace.com?subject=Feedback%20on%20Ownership)\n\n**Target Audience**: DevSecOps, Platform Engineers, SREs\n\n**Documentation and Videos**\n* [(Doc) Ownership](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/manage/ownership)\n* [(Video Tutorial)Ownership driven observability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSE5WvKHxWs)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_ownership_overview.png)","hasContent":true},{"id":"87219f8b-99bf-4b61-b5bf-d36fa31d3d6f","type":"markdown","markdown":"---"},{"id":"c550789b-34e2-43de-98f6-31640b085f4b","type":"markdown","markdown":"# Step 2: Assigning Ownership of entities to team\nAs we have created teams with a team identifier we can now assign those teams as owners to entities.\nTo learn more check out [How to assign owners to entities](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/manage/ownership/assign-ownership) and [Best practices on ownership assignment](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/manage/ownership/best-practices)\n\nIn this tutorial we cover the core use cases\n\n## Option 1: Through Kubernetes Labels\nFor Kubernetes deployments this is the best practice approach by defining the `dt.owner` label on deployments, namespaces, cronjobs, stateful or daemon sets.\n\n```\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: demo\n  labels:\n    dt.owner: my-team\nspec:\n```\n\nYou can also assign multiple teams as different teams may have different responsibilities:\n```\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: demo\n  labels:\n    dt.owner-1: my-team-1 # Dual team ownership defined for the Deployment\n    dt.owner-2: my-team-2\nspec:\n```\n\n## Option 2: Through Environment Variables\nAs ownership is managed through Tags we can also specify the owner information as an environment variable. Here we can either use `DT_TAGS` or `DT_CUSTOM_PROPS` in combination with an auto-tagging rule.\n\n## Option 3: Manually via Dynatrace UI\nYou can also assign teams to an entity on the entity screen in the owners section. Essentially this screen will create a tag called `owner` with the team identifier as its value:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_ownership_addmanually.png)"},{"id":"0a786b4f-1839-434b-989d-53e234e490b9","type":"markdown","markdown":"---"},{"id":"c0f65a02-1004-46cb-9197-b43af7111185","type":"markdown","markdown":"# Step 2: Use Ownership Information as part of a Workflow\nWhen installing the [Ownership App](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/manage/ownership/ownership-app) your workflows can extract ownership information which can be used for targeted workflows, e.g: sending messages to the team slack channel that is specified in the team configuration.\n\nFor more examples please watch [Ownership driven observability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSE5WvKHxWs) and read up on [Ownership App](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/manage/ownership/ownership-app)"},{"id":"ba631e03-e6ff-4fab-861b-01341d119efd","type":"markdown","markdown":"---"},{"id":"d3a15300-adbf-46e1-bf4a-c8115b6d5020","type":"markdown","markdown":"# Step 3: Query Ownership Information\nJust as with everything in Dynatrace we can also query entities based on Ownership information. \n\nHere is an example DQL to query all kubernetes workloads (cloud_application) that are owned by team ninja\n\n```\nfetch dt.entity.cloud_application\n| filter (isNotNull(tags) and indexOf(toString(tags),\"owner:ninja\")>=0) \n| fieldsAdd tags\n```"},{"id":"ea854e12-f636-443b-a363-541c1b95f845","type":"dql","title":"Kubernetes Workloads owned by Team Ninja","showTitle":false,"state":{"input":{"value":"fetch dt.entity.cloud_application\n| filter (isNotNull(tags) and indexOf(toString(tags),\"owner:Ninja\")>=0) \n| fieldsAdd tags","timeframe":{"from":"now-7d","to":"now","details":{"from":{"type":"expression","normalized":"now-7d","date":"2023-09-06T12:25:40.573Z"},"to":{"type":"expression","normalized":"now","date":"2023-09-13T12:25:40.573Z"}}}},"state":"success","davis":{"includeLogs":true,"isDavisVisualizationAvailable":true},"visualizationSettings":{"thresholds":[],"chartSettings":{"gapPolicy":"connect","circleChartSettings":{"groupingThresholdType":"absolute"}},"singleValue":{"showLabel":true,"label":"","prefixIcon":"","autoscale":true,"alignment":"center"},"table":{"rowDensity":"condensed","enableLineWrap":true,"enableSparklines":false,"hiddenColumns":[],"lineWrapIds":[],"firstVisibleRowIndex":0,"columnWidths":{}}},"result":{"code":200,"value":{"records":[{"entity.name":"frontend","id":"CLOUD_APPLICATION-66BFF29866334A5A","tags":["dt.owner:Ninja"]},{"entity.name":"calculationservice","id":"CLOUD_APPLICATION-9C56C2DEB4AD5AA0","tags":["dt.owner:Ninja"]},{"entity.name":"adservice","id":"CLOUD_APPLICATION-CA2305D4EC324955","tags":["dt.owner:Ninja","dt.owner:KDTDemo"]}],"metadata":{"grail":{"canonicalQuery":"fetch dt.entity.cloud_application\n| filter isNotNull(tags) AND indexOf(toString(tags), \"owner:Ninja\") >= 0\n| fieldsAdd tags","timezone":"Europe/Berlin","query":"fetch dt.entity.cloud_application\n| filter (isNotNull(tags) and indexOf(toString(tags),\"owner:Ninja\")>=0) \n| fieldsAdd tags","scannedRecords":58,"dqlVersion":"V1_0","scannedBytes":7867,"analysisTimeframe":{"start":"2023-09-06T15:59:02.359Z","end":"2023-09-13T15:59:02.359Z"},"locale":"","executionTimeMilliseconds":91,"notifications":[],"queryId":"542da9a5-fbe8-4bd0-9682-5d6cecbad667","sampled":false}},"types":[{"mappings":{"entity.name":{"type":"string"},"id":{"type":"string"},"tags":{"type":"array","types":[{"mappings":{"element":{"type":"string"}},"indexRange":[0,0]}]}},"indexRange":[0,1]},{"mappings":{"entity.name":{"type":"string"},"id":{"type":"string"},"tags":{"type":"array","types":[{"mappings":{"element":{"type":"string"}},"indexRange":[0,1]}]}},"indexRange":[2,2]}]},"notifications":[],"dateTime":"2023-09-13T15:59:02.358Z","input":{"value":"fetch dt.entity.cloud_application\n| filter (isNotNull(tags) and indexOf(toString(tags),\"owner:Ninja\")>=0) \n| fieldsAdd tags","timeframe":{"from":"now-7d","to":"now","details":{"from":{"type":"expression","normalized":"now-7d","date":"2023-09-06T12:25:40.573Z"},"to":{"type":"expression","normalized":"now","date":"2023-09-13T12:25:40.573Z"}}}}},"visualization":"table"},"height":189}]}
